# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code
This online day scheduler accepts task inputs from the user, then displays them as a To-Do list. Task display is time dependent and will change as the deadline approaches. Task content blocks are open for edit and are stored for future use.


The user inputs daily tasks into a text field, as time passes the input fields change color tp alert the user that a task dealine is approaching.
